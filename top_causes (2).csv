real wage growth bottom income distribution,2,this development was mainly driven by real wage growth at the bottom of the income distribution.
data unavailability,2,"since the mid-2000s, however, female inequality has started to decrease much faster than male, standing 3 points below male inequality by 2019.

figure 19. gini coefficient of gross individual earnings, overall and by sex, over time












4 other countries have produced gini coefficient figures of gross individual earnings and total employer cost, but that was not possible in this case due to data unavailability."
tax hike government imposed response public debt,2,"direct taxes as a share of gross income have remained relatively steady across the income distribution, increasing between 2011 and 2014 as a result of tax hikes that the government imposed in response to the public debt crisis (figure 28)."
earnings inequality,2,"trends in household income inequality are driven by earnings inequality, patterns of assortative matching and other trends in family composition, and the tax and benefit system."
lower education level,2,"the lower disposable income of immigrants than of natives is partly driven by their lower education level, which feeds into lower employment rates and lower earnings."
large increase minimum wage,2,"since the great recession, and in particular since 2016, wage inequality has fallen for both men and women in part as a result of large increases in the minimum wage."
rising wage inequality top,2,"but inequality in male earnings rose between 1980 and the great recession, driven by rising wage inequality at the top and rising hours inequality at the bottom."
difference talent,2,"what are consequences of inequality


back to top (/en/_site_imf/topics/inequality/introduction-to-inequality#top)



while some inequality is inevitable in a market-based economic system as a result of differences in talent, effort, and luck, excessive inequality could erode social cohesion, lead to political polarization, and ultimately lower economic growth (berg and ostry, 2011; rodrik 1999)."
pandemic imf work inequality issue expected,2,with the expected increase in income inequality as a result of the covid-19 pandemic the imf's work on inequality issues is expected to become even more intense.
unfair progress,1,e) the inequality we see today in the world is the result of unfair progress.
fossil fuel use likely exacerbated economic inequality associated historical,1,"thus, the global warming caused by fossil fuel use has likely exacerbated the economic inequality associated with historical disparities in energy consumption."
expanded wealth rural area industrial sector agriculture transition,1,"in this context, although lewis and kuznets envisaged a downswing, lindert and williamson (2003) suggested that inequality tends to develop due to expanded wealth in rural areas in the industrial sector as agriculture transitions towards business focus."
combination factor,1,this problem   what inequality researcher nora lustig (2019) calls the  missing rich  problem   is due to a combination of factors.
confusion inequality,1,"this might explain the common opinion that income inequality has also risen in belgium, which is at odds with the statistics, but may be due to a confusion between inequality and poverty."
rapid increase employment rate woman,1,for low-educated persons the narrowing of the gender gap seems in recent years more a consequence of the lower employment rate of men than that it is due to a more rapid increase of the employment rate for women than for men.
concentration small income administrative data,1,further investigation tells us that this is due to a concentration of small incomes in the administrative data which seem not to be reported in surveys.
major change income data collected canadian,1,"because of a major change in how income data were collected in the canadian census in 2006, we are frequently constrained in the number of years we can report in the figures."
declining market income bottom distribution,1,"figure 20 shows the same pattern that inequality ratchets up with the 1980 and 1990 recessions, driven by declining market income at the bottom of the distribution."
change bottom decile relative median,1,"relative poverty also rising slightly between 2005 and 2010, but declines overall from 21% to 20% between 2005 and 2015.
to further characterise inequality trends during this period, we plot quantile ratios for real disposable household income in figure 40. between 2005 and 2015, the 90:10 ratio falls slightly from 4.9 to 4.5, which is driven by changes in the bottom decile relative to the median."
sharp decrease earnings inequality among woman end,1,"decomposition by gender shows that this decrease is mainly driven by a sharp decrease in earnings inequality among women at


the end of the 1990s (figure 21)."
disability able since benefit another type,1,"individuals who cannot work because of a disability have been able since 1975 to benefit from another type of income support, more generous than the standard social minimum."
combination increase minimum wage,1,"inequality in the growth of individual earnings has remained quite stable over the period at around 0.31 in terms of the gini, as can be seen in figure 19. by contrast, inequality in employer cost increased, as shown by figure 20. this fact is likely due to the combination of increases in the minimum wage and large cuts in sscs at the bottom of the distribution."
driven composition effect female employment among prime woman,1,"employment rates among men have remained close to constant at high levels, so that the gender employment gap still amounts to 7 percentage points in 2019. however, as younger cohorts no longer display a strong difference in male and female employment rates, it is likely that due to cohort- driven composition effects female employment among all prime working-age women will continue to grow, further narrowing the gender employment gap in the future."
transfer targeted household,1,"looking at the tax and transfer system as a whole, its main redistributive effects are due to transfers targeted at low-income households and the provision of public services, while the tax system itself is only mildly progressive as vat and social security contributions counteract the progressiveness of the income tax."
insecurity regarding data gross income,1,"however, the results for hourly wages are also subject to greater uncertainty due to the insecurities regarding the data on gross income and hours worked in connection with short-time work during the 2020 pandemic year (see chapter 3. notes on measurement and definitions)."
considerable increase collectively agreed wage composition effect,1,"again, this might be due to considerable increases in collectively agreed wages in 2020 or a composition effect caused by the disproportionately sharp decline in marginally employed workers in the lower tail of the income distribution."
disproportionately sharp decline marginally employed worker lower tail,1,"again, this might be due to considerable increases in collectively agreed wages in 2020 or a composition effect caused by the disproportionately sharp decline in marginally employed workers in the lower tail of the income distribution."
reduction female earnings inequality,1,the recent decline in the gini can be partially attributed to a reduction in female earnings inequality.
rising wage inequality rather rising hour inequality,1,"as shown above, this rise in male earnings inequality has been driven by rising wage inequality rather than rising hours inequality."
shift lower half income distribution,1,"inequality has fallen across most of the distribution in the last decade after substantial increases in earnings dispersion in the period from 1993 to 2011. over the whole period, there has been only a small rise in inequality due to shifts in the lower half of the income distribution (captured by the 50:10 ratio) but moderate increases in the 90:10 ratio, with gross individual earnings at the 90th percentile being more than eight times higher than income at the 10th percentile in 2019 (compared to a ratio of roughly 6 in 1983)."
